### 4.1.17: Unreleased

**Bug fixes:**

- Fix for energy data that was not being stored for the last job of the batch #2657 #2418
- Reduce the frequency with which energy data was not being stored for the last job of the batch #2657 #2418
- Fixed issue with experiments running on LOCAL platform without a defined LOCAL entry in platforms.yml config file #1131
- Fixed an issue with the ECMWF platform not working with the new online recovery

**Enhancements:**

- Fix characters escaped in regexes #2526
- Fixed RO-Crate validation issues with the latest `rocrate-validator`,
  now Autosubmit crates conform to RO-Crate 1.1, process 0.5, workflow run
  crate 0.5, and workflow ro crate 1.0. A new integration test has been
  added to check that we produce valid crates with the `rocrate-validator` #2816
- Changed Yaml load mode from 'safe' to 'rt' #2851

### 4.1.16: Postgres (experimental) support, bug fixes, and enhancements

This release adds support to Postgres using SQLAlchemy, without removing the
SQLite support. By default, Autosubmit will use SQLite. Postgres support is
experimental and not recommended for production yet.

Autosubmit Config Parser code has been merged back into this code base. LOCAL
platform does not support wrappers anymore (it was used for testing).

The `--notransitive` argument has been deprecated in all commands. You may still
use it without a failure, but there will be a warning displayed asking you to
update your command line. This argument will be completely removed on a later
release.

**Bug fixes:**

- Fixed issue with the verification of dirty Git local repositories in operational experiments #2446
- Fixed error when cleaning projects that use Git #2524
- Fixed bug that occurred when copying experiments with different HPC platforms, where the incorrect platform was used 
  instead of the user-specified platform #2650

- Fixed bug where an RO-Crate file would include itself in the archive, as well as other zip files.
  Now Autosubmit uses the pattern $expid-crate-$date-$time-$millisecond.zip, and ignores any ZIP files
  in the tmp/ASLOGS that start with $expid-crate and end with .zip #2692

  `HPC*` variables (e.g. `%HPC_DN_SERVER%` of a user platform) #2574
- Used a Shell trap-function to detect when an Autosubmit job is signalled to stop
  and to handle non-zero exit codes writing the `_STAT` files (for GUI/metrics) #2788 #2807
- Fixed an issue with MIXED and STRICT wrapper policies raising the error prematurely #2770
- Do not print warning if an experiment has been successfully deleted #2334 #2793

### 4.1.15: Bug fixes, enhancements, and new features

The filter `-fp` of the command `autosubmit stats` changed in this release.
Previously, a `-fp 0` would not raise any errors, and would bring all the
jobs, just like when no filter is provided. Now both negative numbers and
`0` (zero) raise an error, and only values greater than `0` are used to compute
the filter the jobs. Not using any value for `-fp` still returns all jobs.

**Bug fixes:**

- Corrected the logic for handling `ZombieProcess` errors in `psutil` calls done in `autosubmit stop`, which
  prevented the command from working correctly if the experiment process appeared after a zombie in the list #2394
- Fixed an issue with Autosubmit's CITATION.cff that prevented Zenodo from automatically
  adding new deposits via its webhook #2401
- Deleted command `autosubmit test` that was not working in Autosubmit 4 #2386
- Removed PBS and SGE platforms as they are not working in AS4 #2349
- Log levels in the command line now accept `ERROR` #2412
- Fix setstatus command to work in all cases #2381
- Fix PS platform to work with the local machine #2374
- Fixed a `ZeroDivisionError` when using RO-Crate or `stats`, and also an issue
  where the message said `None` could not be iterable. #2389
- Fixed a bug that produces an infinite loop when it is not possible to create log files #2618

**Enhancements:**

- EDITO Autosubmit-Demo container updated to install API in different environment #2398
- Update portalocker requirement from <=3.1.1 to <=3.2.0 #2423
